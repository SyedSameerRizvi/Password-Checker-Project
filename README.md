# Password-Checker-Project

       Before starting this project, I always wondered that the website https://haveibeenpwned.com is storing or saving my passowrds in a database in which I inputted to check that whether is it hacked or not. I know it is a safe website but still I felt insecure about it.

       So, I decided to create a small project in which it checks the password entered is hacked how many times using an api of the pwnedpasswords website. In this way, The passwords you enter and check would not be saved/stored in a database just only on your system
